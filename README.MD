# Elevator Saga

Elevator Saga is a fun little JavaScript game where you are suppose to create the AI for a few elevators that move between 1st and 20th floor in a building.

The game is well documented and easy to get into.

# My Code

This is my take on the game and a possible solution for some of the floors. I strongly suggest you only use this code if you're stuck. Consider this to be cheat codes for the game.

# Credit

I take no credit for creating the game!
